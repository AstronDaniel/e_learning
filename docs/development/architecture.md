# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the E-Learning Platform's architecture, describing key components and their interactions.

## System Architecture

The E-Learning Platform follows a traditional Django MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture:

```
├── Models: Database schema and business logic
├── Views: Request handling and response generation
├── Templates: HTML rendering with Django template language
├── URLs: Request routing
└── Forms: User input handling and validation
```

## Core Components

### User Management (users app)

- User authentication and authorization
- User profiles (student and instructor roles)
- Dashboard views
- User settings

### Course Management (courses app)

- Course creation and organization
- Content management (lessons, sections)
- Enrollment tracking
- Progress monitoring

### Quiz System (quizzes app)

- Question bank management
- Quiz creation and configuration
- Assessment handling
- Result tracking and analytics

### Forum System (forums app)

- Discussion threads
- Commenting functionality
- Notification system
- Moderation tools

### Instructor Tools (instructor app)

- Course analytics
- Student performance tracking
- Grading tools
- Content management

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication Flow**
   - User submits credentials
   - Django authenticates against user model
   - Session created for authorized users
   - User redirected to appropriate dashboard

2. **Course Enrollment Flow**
   - Student browses course catalog
   - Student initiates enrollment
   - System creates enrollment record
   - Course appears in student dashboard

3. **Content Delivery Flow**
   - User requests course content
   - Permission check for enrollment
   - Content retrieved from database/filesystem
   - Content rendered to user with appropriate template

4. **Quiz Taking Flow**
   - Student accesses quiz
   - System delivers questions
   - Student submits answers
   - System evaluates responses
   - Results stored and displayed

## Database Schema

The platform uses a relational database with the following key models:

- `User`: Extended Django user model
- `Profile`: Additional user information
- `Course`: Course metadata
- `Section`: Course structure elements
- `Lesson`: Individual content units
- `Enrollment`: Student-course relationship
- `Quiz`: Assessment container
- `Question`: Individual quiz items
- `Response`: Student answers to questions
- `Forum`: Discussion containers
- `Thread`: Forum topics
- `Comment`: Individual forum posts

## External Integrations

The system supports integration with:

- File storage systems (local or cloud storage)
- Email delivery services
- Payment gateways (for paid courses)
- Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) providers

## Security Considerations

- Django's built-in security features (CSRF, XSS protection)
- Permissions-based access control
- Content isolation between courses
- Rate limiting for sensitive operations
- Input validation and sanitization

## Scalability Design

The application architecture supports scaling through:

- Database connection pooling
- Caching frequently-accessed content
- Stateless request handling
- Media file offloading to CDN
- Horizontal scaling of web servers
